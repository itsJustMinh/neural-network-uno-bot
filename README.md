## To-Do List:
- [ ] Fix bug where if a player uses a reverse card and then draws in a 2-player match, it'll be their turn again.
- [x] Fix bug where if you play a draw card the opponent doesn't actually draw cards.
- [ ] Fix bug where BufferedReader randomly crashes and breaks the game. I still don't know how to fix that  
- [ ] FINISH THE REST OF THE DARN GAME

## About Code
This code is supposed to train an artificial to learn and master the Uno(r) game in order for me
to ~~beat my girlfriend/put it on my brag sheet~~ understand advanced concepts that a high school sophomore isn't supposed
to know at that age.

## About Authors
In this 2020-2021 School year, Logan and I are both high schoolers, with Logan being a senior and me a sophomore.
### Minh Nguyen
I'm the owner of this repository, and the person that came up with the idea to code an AI to master Uno!™. I also coded
the majority of the classes required for the code.
### Logan Simon
He's cool and a very good friend of mine.
