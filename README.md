## About Code
This code is supposed to train an artificial to learn and master the Uno(r) game in order for me
to ~~beat my girlfriend/put it on my brag sheet~~ understand advanced concepts that a high school sophomore isn't supposed
to know at that age.

## About Authors
In this 2020-2021 School year, Logan and I are both high schoolers, with Logan being a senior and me a sophomore.
###Minh Nguyen
I'm the owner of this repository, and the person that came up with the idea to code an AI to master Uno!™. I also coded
the majority of the classes required for the code.
###Logan Simon
he's cool.
